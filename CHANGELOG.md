# Changelog

All notable changes to hypergumbo are documented in this file. The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

- Released **tool** is at: v1.1.0
- Released **schema** is at: v0.2.1

This changelog tracks the **tool version** (package releases). The **schema version** is tracked separately in `schema.py` as `SCHEMA_VERSION`. The schema version changes when `docs/schema.json` has significant updates: breaking changes to the behavior map output format (minor bump) or additions like new type definitions for YAML validation (patch bump).

## [Unreleased]

### Summary
- **Analyzers:** large expansion (languages + templates + config/build/docs); highlights: Twig, SCSS/Sass, Prisma, Smithy, BitBake, Robot Framework, KDL.
- **CLI:** `compact` subcommand to convert existing behavior maps to LLM-friendly compact form (no re-analysis).
- **Quality:** INV-002 fallback resolution; non-object `package.json` / `composer.json` no longer crash; Python nested decorated functions now extracted (FastAPI router factory pattern); Python `if __name__ == "__main__"` structural entrypoint detection (adds `main_guard` concept to module symbols).
- **Agent workflow:** invariant-ledger now treats **UNFIXED** + **PARTIALLY ADDRESSED** as actionable; bakeoff guidance tightened (agents-policy-v2026-01-25.0).
- **Tests:** Scala lambda attribution tests for INV-001; Python nested function extraction tests; Python main guard detection tests (7 tests).

### Added

### Changed
- **Agent policy / bakeoff loop** (agents-policy-v2026-01-25.0):
  - Treat **UNFIXED** and **PARTIALLY ADDRESSED** invariants as blocking/actionable (incl. “stopping point” checks).
  - Reflection now focuses on remaining signals **for the last change made**, and requires confirming the ledger is up-to-date:
    - `cat .agent/invariant-ledger.md 2>/dev/null | grep -E -A5 'Status: (❌( UNFIXED)?|UNFIXED|PARTIALLY ADDRESSED)' || true`
  - If an invariant is unfixed (even partially) and analogous issues might exist: **do not stop**—fix/investigate; otherwise document and consider reactivating `scripts/bakeoff*`.
  - Canary bumped to `agents-policy-v2026-01-25.0`.

### Fixed
- **INV-002 (ADR-0008)**: Proper deferred resolution for `UsageContext(symbol_ref=None)`. Added `resolve_deferred_symbol_refs()` phase that runs after all analyzers complete, using `NameResolver` with multi-strategy lookup (exact → suffix → path hint) to resolve string-based handler references. This enables concept annotations for Django URL patterns, Express routes, and any framework using cross-file handler references. 17 regression tests.
- **JSON manifests**: Avoid crash when `package.json` / `composer.json` top-level JSON is non-object; affected `_detect_js_frameworks`, `_detect_php_frameworks`, `detect_package_roots`, `_extract_package_json` (sketch).
- **Python nested functions**: Extract decorated nested functions (closures) for FastAPI router factory pattern. Previously, only top-level functions were extracted, missing route handlers like `@router.get("/entities") def list_entities()` inside factory functions.

### Tests
- Added Scala lambda call attribution tests for INV-001 (`lambda_expression` nodes).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-01-24

> Note: This version was tagged in the codebase but never published to PyPI. It marks a milestone with breaking changes relative to v1.0.0. Hopefully our next release will be hiccup-free and actually publish to PyPI.

### Removed

- **Vestigial capsule system** (ADR cleanup)
  - Removed `init` and `export-capsule` commands (marked vestigial in spec)
  - Removed `plan.py`, `llm_assist.py`, `export.py` modules
  - Removed deprecated `Pack` class from catalog (packs replaced by linker activation conditions)
  - Removed `llm-assist` and `llm-local` optional dependencies from pyproject.toml

### Added

**YAML-Driven Analysis (ADR-0003)**
- Main function detection via `main-functions.yaml` for 10 languages (Go, Java, Python, C, C++, Rust, C#, Kotlin, Swift, Dart)
- Test function detection via `test-frameworks.yaml` for 10+ frameworks (pytest, JUnit, RSpec, etc.)
- Language conventions: CUDA kernels, WGSL shaders, COBOL, LaTeX, Starlark (`language-conventions.yaml`)
- Config conventions: NPM, Maven, Android, Cargo, Poetry, TypeScript (`config-conventions.yaml`)
- Pattern system extended with `symbol_name`, `language`, and `prefix_from_parent` fields
- Framework pattern types added to `docs/schema.json` for YAML validation
- YAML linting via `yamllint` in pre-commit hooks
- Play Framework patterns for Scala (`play.yaml`): controllers, Action blocks, WebSocket handlers
- Akka HTTP patterns for Scala (`akka-http.yaml`): route directives, method handlers, WebSocket, auth
- Library export detection (`library-exports.yaml`): Detects exports from index files (index.ts/js/jsx/tsx) as library entry points for JS/TS libraries

**New Commands & Flags**
- `hypergumbo test-coverage`: Static coverage estimation via call graph analysis
- `-x/--exclude-tests`: Exclude test files from sketch sections
- `--progress`: Show ETA during sketch generation
- `--readme-debug`: Debug README extraction algorithm
- `--help --all`: Show all subcommand help at once
- `slice --flat`: Output simple `{nodes, edges}` format for external tools (implies `--inline`)

**Sketch Improvements**
- Source code included by default (`--no-source` to disable)
- "How Representative Is This Sketch?" table showing coverage per section
- README-first hybrid ranking for Additional Files (round-robin: linked/similar/central)
- Multi-format README link extraction (Markdown, Org-mode, RST, AsciiDoc)
- Embedding-based README description extraction with pre-computed probes
- Estimated coverage in Tests section (e.g., "~35% estimated coverage")
- Separate test/non-test LOC breakdown in Overview

**Analyzer Improvements**
- Shared SymbolResolver framework for cross-file resolution (45+ analyzers)
- Parameter type inference for Python, Java, Kotlin, TypeScript
- Common Lisp analyzer (`.lisp`, `.lsp`, `.cl`, `.asd`)
- LLVM IR analyzer (`.ll` files)
- ADR-0004: File taxonomy with `FileRole` enum and 75+ language specs
- ADR-0007: Import tracking for cross-file call resolution
  - Phase 1 complete: JS/TS, Kotlin bug fixes
  - Phase 2 complete: Rust, C#, Ruby, Elixir, Swift, PHP, Scala, Dart
  - Phase 3A complete: Ada, Agda, Clojure, C++, D, Elm, Erlang, F#, Fortran, Groovy, Haskell, Julia, Nim, OCaml, R, Solidity, Starlark, Zig (18 done; Lean blocked by grammar, VHDL has no aliasing)

**CLI Ergonomics**
- Auto-run analysis for query commands when no cached results exist
- Auto-discovery of cached results from `~/.cache/hypergumbo/`
- Slice path suffix matching (`--entry src/main.go` matches full paths)
- Symbol-specific slice output naming (`slice.main.json`)
- Artifact location reporting and summary after `hypergumbo run`
- Forge URL resolution for README links (GitHub/GitLab/Codeberg)

### Changed
- **auto-pr uses fast-forward merge by default**: Preserves commit bodies and DCO. Prompts to rebase if diverged. `--squash` available as emergency fallback (uses git notes).
- **Schema version 0.2.1**: Added framework pattern types to `docs/schema.json`
- Section headers renamed: "Source Content" → "Source Files Content", etc.
- Overview always shows test/non-test breakdown; Tests section always present
- Additional Files excludes boilerplate (LICENSE, .gitignore, CODEOWNERS)
- CI skips expensive jobs for docs-only PRs
- pytest-xdist for parallel tests (`pytest -n auto`)

### Fixed

**Git Notes Recovery**
- Restored 193 orphaned commit bodies via git notes (squash-merged Jan 9-22 2026). View: `git log --show-notes`

**Compact Mode**
- Edge filter changed from OR to AND (was wasting 99%+ on dangling edges)
- Entrypoints filtered to resolvable IDs (fixes "No entrypoints detected")
- Force-include entrypoints in selection (preserves semantic anchors)
- Connectivity-aware selection using greedy frontier algorithm (4x more edges)
- Entrypoints capped to `max_symbols // 2` to leave room for bridge nodes

**Sketch Output**
- File content truncation accounts for markers (~130 chars overhead); files end with newline
- `-x` flag correctly counts non-code repos
- Unified test detection between Overview and Tests sections
- Added `tests.py` and `*_spec.rb` to test detection
- Structure section: tree format with `-x`, shows all root directories, handles flat repos
- Representativeness table shows with `-x` and correct budget for small sketches
- Additional Files representativeness uses mention centrality
- Elevator pitch truncation respects sentence boundaries
- Embedding-based README extraction handles soft line breaks

**Call Graph**
- C/C++ analyzers prefer definitions over declarations (fixes coverage estimation)
- NestJS route paths combine controller + method via `prefix_from_parent`
- NestJS routes normalize to start with `/` (fixes `[GET] test` → `[GET] /test`)
- Framework aliases: Go web frameworks (gin, chi, echo, fiber) now load `go-web.yaml`; Rust web frameworks (axum, actix-web, rocket, warp) now load `rust-web.yaml`
- Python: submodule imports resolve (`from app import crud; crud.func()`)
- Python: imported class method calls resolve (`from X import Class; Class.method()`)

**Entrypoints**
- `slice --list-entries` now respects `--exclude-tests` and `--max-tier` filters

**Other**
- `explain --with-source` output ordering (callers/callees grouped with sources)
- Minimum chunk size for license files in semantic search
- Removed misleading "Coverage requires execution" message

## [1.0.0] - 2026-01-12 (not released to PyPI)

> **Note:** This version was tagged in the codebase but never published to PyPI. It marks a milestone with breaking changes relative to v0.9.1.

Major focus on memory optimization, framework detection improvements,
and completing the migration to YAML-driven semantic analysis.

### Fixed
- **Memory optimization for large repos:** Reduced peak memory from ~11GB to ~2.1GB (80%
  reduction) for repositories like tensorflow. Uses streaming JSON output and aggressive
  cleanup of intermediate data structures.
- **Android framework detection:** Now detects Android via `android {}` blocks in build.gradle,
  AndroidManifest.xml presence, and gradle plugin dependencies.
- **JSON serialization of Python literals:** Complex numbers and bytes literals no longer cause errors.
- **`--frameworks all` and explicit lists:** Now bypass dependency scanning, enabling pattern
  matching even when manifests are in subdirectories.
- **Express route detection:** Fixed case-sensitive HTTP method comparison.
- **Slice command:** Now runs all language analyzers, not just Python/HTML.

### Added
- **Recursive manifest scanning:** Scans up to 3 levels deep for dependency manifests (monorepo support).
- **Ruby/Elixir framework detection:** Gemfile and mix.exs scanning for Rails, Phoenix, etc.
- **Usage-based pattern matching:** Route detection for call-based frameworks (Django `path()`,
  Express `app.get()`, Rails route DSL, Go Gin, etc.) via YAML patterns.
- **12 new framework YAML patterns:** ktor, vapor, plug, fastify, grape, tornado, aiohttp,
  slim, micronaut, graphql, electron, cli.

### Changed
- **Entrypoint detection now 100% YAML-driven:** Removed 26 legacy detection functions (~1,700 lines).

## [0.9.1] - 2026-01-09

### Fixed
- **Incomplete v0.9.0 release:** v0.9.0 was accidentally built from the wrong branch. This
  release includes all ADR-0003 features. Users should upgrade from v0.9.0 to v0.9.1.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-01-09 (INCOMPLETE RELEASE)

> **Warning:** This release was built from the wrong branch. Please use v0.9.1 instead.

### Changed (Breaking)
- **Schema version 0.2.0:** New `entrypoints` field added to behavior map output.

### Added
- **`--frameworks` flag:** Control framework detection (`none`, `all`, `fastapi,celery`, or auto-detect).
- **Entrypoints in JSON output:** Detected entrypoints now persisted in output with stable IDs.
- **Smart JSON detection in slice command:** `.json` files auto-detected as `--input`.
- **Connectivity-based entrypoint ranking:** Entrypoints ranked by graph connectivity for better `--entry auto`.
- **Linker activation conditions:** Linkers now have structured activation criteria (always, frameworks, language_pairs).
- **Rich metadata extraction:** Decorators/annotations with args/kwargs for Python, JS/TS, Java, C#.
- **YAML-driven framework patterns:** Data-driven symbol enrichment via `src/hypergumbo/frameworks/*.yaml`.
  - Initial patterns for: FastAPI, Flask, Django, Express, NestJS, Spring Boot, Rails, Phoenix,
    Laravel, Go web frameworks (Gin/Echo/Fiber/Chi), Rust web frameworks (Actix/Rocket),
    ASP.NET Core, Hapi, Koa, Celery, and more.
  - See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for the full pattern inventory.
- **Semantic entry detection:** Entrypoint detection via concept metadata (highest priority, 0.95 confidence).
- **HTTP linker concept support:** Extracts route info from concept metadata.

### Changed
- **Python analyzer purified:** Route detection moved from analyzer to YAML patterns.

### Deprecated
- **Packs:** Framework-specific analysis now uses `--frameworks` flag instead of packs.
- **Path-based entrypoint heuristics:** Prefer semantic detection via YAML patterns.
- **Analyzer-level route detection:** Route detection moving to YAML patterns (1.0.x migration).

## [0.6.9] - 2026-01-07

### Added
- **Connectivity-aware auto-slicing:** `--entry auto` prefers well-connected entrypoints.
- **Improved slice traversal:** Synthetic linker nodes connected via `uses` edges.
- **Stronger cross-file call resolution:** Module-qualified calls and lightweight type inference.
- **Linker diagnostics:** `LinkerRequirement` checks and registry pattern for linker execution.
- **Variable-based linker matching:** URLs/event names in variables detected (lower confidence).

### Fixed
- **Route detection false positives:** Excluded `fetchMock.get()`, `axios.post()`, etc. from Express routes.
- **Entrypoint false positives:** Excluded React file-routing, non-web handlers, DNS resolvers, etc.

### Changed
- **Linker consolidation:** All linkers migrated to `@register_linker` registry pattern.

## [0.6.0] - 2025-12-29

### Added
- **New analyzers:** Lean 4 (theorem prover), Wolfram Language (Mathematica), Agda (proof assistant).
- **Build-from-source grammars:** `scripts/build-source-grammars` for experimental tree-sitter grammars.
- **Contributor workflow:** `scripts/contribute` for fork-based contributions.
- **Release automation:** `scripts/release-check`, `scripts/release`, `scripts/integration-test`.
- **Sketch improvements:** Two-phase symbol selection, per-file compression, deterministic output.

See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for the full language/framework support matrix.
